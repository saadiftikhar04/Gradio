    "5. **Advanced Applications**: Combining multiple models and layouts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interface**: Quick way to create a web app from a Python function\n",
    "- **Blocks**: Advanced layout system for custom designs\n",
    "- **Row**: Places components horizontally side by side\n",
    "- **Column**: Stacks components vertically within a row\n",
    "- **Pipeline**: Huggingface's simple API for using pre-trained models\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Experiment with different Huggingface models from the model hub\n",
    "- Try combining multiple rows and columns for complex layouts\n",
